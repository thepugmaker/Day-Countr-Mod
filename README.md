# Day-Countr-Mod
Day counter mod for Minecraft, Made in Fabric.
This is my first mod I am publishing.
# How to build
`Intellij IDEA` 
Open the project in `Intellij`, Open the folder with all the code in it, go into gradle and then tasks and find build, 
After you find build Run it, and then you'll see in the `builds`.`libs` folder will be the `dayconuntr-(version).jar` and then thats the build!
Good job you have now built my mod!
# Others
First other is my icon was made quicky and I plan to make it better. 
Next thing this will be updated a lot! This was testing on a 1980 x 1080 screen the most, 
If you have a problem go put up a issue oand I will try to fix it as fast as I can!
